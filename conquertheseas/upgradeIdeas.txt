unit holds list of lists - each list is an upgrade

[
[level: int, name:str, cost:int, lineTo: index of other ability, description:str, active:method]
]

example:

[
[level: 1, name:poop, cost:50, lineTo: 3]
[level: 1, name:butts, cost:50, lineTo: None]
[level: 1, name:shit, cost:50, lineTo: None]
[level: 2, name:SUPERpoop, cost:50, lineTo: None]
]

this draws
