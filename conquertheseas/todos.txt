================
-- WHATS NEXT --
================
- collisions (  :(  )
  - rank of hitting (defense vs offense vs boolit)
- single machine multiplayer
  - starting with 3 uncontrollable defensive
  - ghetto turn system

=================
-- SMALL TODOS -- 
If you're bored and looking for something to add to this fix deez things.
=================
- Screen transitions are HI-LARIOUSLY bad. Fix dat.
- Unit highlight size not reset until mousemove :(
- Shift-click for multiplace offensive units

=================
-- LARGE TODOS --
=================
- Any game logic, whatsoever.
- Upgrade screen
- Pause menu
- Options in the main menu currently do nothing, and work similarly
  to the newgame submenu, for some reason. This is not expected behaviour.
- Animation dictionary: associates strings to arrays of coordinates, which coorespond to tiles
- Offensive select should work like a board, have click detection
- Create a defensive unit larger than 1x1, plays properly
- Move system
- Resources

====================
-- POSSIBLE FIXES --
====================
- Perhaps we should make a "button" class that associates visuals and click/overboxes.
  - in that case MouseHitboxes should be a composite pattern, which could get a little ugly but doable.

====================
-- DESIGN CHOICES --
====================
Each Submit is split into Turns, so if you dump all your points into one defensive unit he moves once, then again, then again, once per turn, but at the end of the Submit he is where you put him. Offensive units are sent in at a turn depending on where you set them in the starting area, so:

          012
.............
.............
.............
.............
.............

if you set it at column zero it comes from the right at time 0, 1 at 1, 2 at 2.
