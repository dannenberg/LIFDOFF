=================
-- SMALL TODOS -- 
If you're bored and looking for something to add to this fix deez things.
=================
- Unit highlight size not reset until mousemove :(
- Stop shooting yourself. Stop shooting yourself. Stop shooting yourself. Stop shooting yourself

=================
-- LARGE TODOS --
=================
- Upgrade screen
- Pause menu
- Options in the main menu currently do nothing, and work similarly
  to the newgame submenu, for some reason. This is not expected behaviour.
- Animation dictionary: associates strings to arrays of coordinates, which coorespond to tiles

====================
-- DESIGN CHOICES --
====================
Each Submit is split into Turns, so if you dump all your points into one defensive unit he moves once, then again, then again, once per turn, but at the end of the Submit he is where you put him. Offensive units are sent in at a turn depending on where you set them in the starting area, so:

          012
.............
.............
.............
.............
.............

if you set it at column zero it comes from the right at time 0, 1 at 1, 2 at 2.
