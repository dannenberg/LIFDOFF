section 3: what kind of diagrams

class name
class variables
	int balance;
	- sentence or two describing why you have that variable inside that class
- list every single class variable
- then talk about class methods

- public void deposit(int amount)
	- sentence or two describing why you have that function
	
- it's really about a detailed description of everything in your project
	- doesn't have to be EVERY SINGLE THING but the most important variables and functions
	
- BEFORE you do this, provide some kind of diagrams to teach the reader how your program is actually going to function
- series of diagrams up and down that will help teach the reader so that they will be able to 
	interpret your code shit
- can really use any diagrams you want
- want domain model
	- then divided into modules (system, subsystem, whatever language you want to use) 
- detailed UML

- ONLY for one simple subsystem do we need to do the detailed UML and the variable/method shit
