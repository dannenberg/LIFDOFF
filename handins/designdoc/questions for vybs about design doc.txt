questions for vybs

Policies and Tactics
? Goals (of this document and in this software 
build)
? Guidelines (in developing this document)
? Development methods (of this document – how 
did we do this – for trace back purposes)

this stuff is all just for the document?  not guidelines or development methods of the actual software?

audience: how many things do we need?  this doesn't line up with the users of the game 
(we had hardcore, moderate, light, server users) right?  currently have players and software devs

how much detail in the dia file we have?  i'll show him and ask if that's what's needed - variables for everything
with explanation for only one, or only variables for that one?

Architecture considerations
	? Technology selection & it's application area - is this just like...python, pygame - SOCKETS
Design Considerations:
	? Assumptions, dependencies, general constraints - what?  what does this apply to?  is this diagrams?
High-level design
	? System overview discussion - this is like... we have a server, that connects to clients, etc
	? Design pattern identification - we used client-server model, talk about this
	? Final domain model - how much detail?  what is this, specifically?
		– Showing major classes & design patterns - showing unit class, etc? = just giant uml diagram of all classes?
	? Final deployment diagram - what is this?  - allocation diagram
	
Section 3: The Specifications
? Software Organization
	? Your view of the subsystems of project in text and drawing, using a block/UML diagram (all classes)
		- is this actually all classes?  of everything?
	? Package diagram (if needed) - what is this?
? Module / Object Decomposition	 - connector
	? Detailed system design by subsystems using filled out UML Class Diagrams
	– CRC, Class Diagram, calling sequence diagrams & 
		detailed design text
	– State charts, Interaction diagrams (as needed)
? Critical Section Specification ??????????????????????????????????
	? Entity Relationship & Data Dictionary - if we don't have a database, do we need this?
	? Low level architecture (if needed) - i don't know what this is - data structures?  algos?
