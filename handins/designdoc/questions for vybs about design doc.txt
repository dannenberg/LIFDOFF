questions for vybs

Policies and Tactics
? Goals (of this document and in this software 
build)
? Guidelines (in developing this document)
? Development methods (of this document – how 
did we do this – for trace back purposes)

audience: how many things do we need?  this doesn't line up with the users of the game 
(we had hardcore, moderate, light, server users) right?  currently have players and software devs
