cover page
  trival (someone make it in word)
  maybe steal the LIFDOFF logo from SBAHJ

Table of contents
  apparently we need one... very trivial

project overview  === DONE ===================================
  name idea duties 
  client info (vybs)
  project overview for real
    explain what are game is and why it will be cool/successful

Systems Diagram
  Screenshot and UML Diagram

formal phased project breakdown ==== DONE ==================
  break project into steps
    break steps into activities
  present as table (see week3day2)


dated activity graph
  take that activities from above and divide them where they can be paralized

milestones and deliverables == DONEEEEEEEEEEE =================
  table with event id title result date and dependencies
  i guess this is different from steps and activities?
  if not this pretty easy
  deliverables are just bundles of miles stones that are presentable
    i guess they could be steps and miles stones could be activities?

resource requirements table === DONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ================
  item id description unit cost quantity subtotal event id dependencies
  no idea what this is for.. cuz we dont have any resources cept time maybe?
    but there is not a chance in hell we will estimate that accurately
  this may be more for external contracts?

cost estimate (bullshit) === DONEEEEEEEEEEEEE ======================
  programmer hourly rate total hours subtotal dependencies
  again we arent getting paid... no idea what this is for maybe just estimate man hours

engineering methods
  software process model (waterfall)
  programming development (incremental)
  team organization (dont remember what this means... scrum??)
  process assessment rules (??)
  change control moethods (code repo handling requirement changes)
    not sure we have to deal with requirement changes
    and repo is git so i guess we should list our gith ub stuff

risk identification
  we need to list somethings
    i cant think of any aside from not being on top of shit
      so maybe we should arrange biweekly meetings to combat slacking?




QUESTIONS for VYBS

1. What's the deal with airplane foood?
2. What's the difference between milestones/deliverables and activities/steps
3. Resource/cost estimate for in-house project?  What do?
