1 Paragraph Description:

A two (minimum) player turn-based strategy game.  
Each player has 2 components to manage - protecting their defensive unit (a spaceship?), and sending offensive units (asteroids, evil spaceships?) to destroy the other player's main unit.  Each player gains resources by destroying the units sent to attack them, and then uses these resources to buy attacking units to send at their opponent.  Players move their defensive unit multiple moves at a time which are all executed after both players have decided upon their moves.  When all opposing players have had their defensive unit destroyed by the offensive units, the last player remaining wins.
