1 Paragraph Description:

A turn-based strategy game for multiple players (or a single player against AI). Each player has 2 components to manage - protecting their three defensive units (space ships?), and sending offensive units (asteroids, aliens?) to destroy the other player's three defensive units. Each player gains resources (xp and gold) at the start of each turn and by destroying the units sent to attack them. These resources are used to buy offensive units to send at their opponent. Each turn, players plans the next five moves (steps or shots) of their defensive units and may purchase offensive unites or upgrades to their defensive units. These moves are executed after all players have locked in their plan. When all opposing players have had their defensive unit destroyed, the remaining player wins.
