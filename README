1 Paragraph Description:

A turn-based strategy game for multiple players (or a single player against AI). Each player has 2 components to manage - protecting their multiple defensive units (space ships?), and sending offensive units (asteroids, aliens?) to destroy the other player's defensive units. Each player gains resources (experience points and money) at the start of each turn and by destroying the units sent to attack them. These resources are used to buy offensive units to send at their opponent. Each turn, players plans the next several moves (moving their units, using offensive abilities like shooting or attacking) of their defensive units and may purchase offensive units or upgrades to their defensive units. These moves are executed after all players have locked in their plan. When all opposing players have had their defensive units destroyed, the remaining player wins.

Welcome screen: There will be a welcome screen.
Resource management: Defensive units defeating attackers will earn their team money and experience points, which can be used to send attackers and purchase upgrades on the upgrade tree
Map generation: At the beginning of a round the entire playing board will be generated, and will be identical for both boards. Certain types of terrain will be more beneficial to some units, or units with certain upgrades.
Team management: Players must preplan the moves of each defensive unit and decide when to deploy offensive units.
Networked: for multiplayer, expandable to many players with different modes of play (choose who to attack, everyone attacks a different player, teams)
Databases: for saved games (single player only?)
