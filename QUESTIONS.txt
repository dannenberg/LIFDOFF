Questions for Vybs:

WHAT'S the deal with airline food? (WILL NEVER GET OLD)
Is the diagram clear + proper (server-client)
Are our use cases good enough
& lastly is our combo of use cases + client server diagram + screenshots sufficient for section 3 or did we miss something?????????????????????????????
+ then i guess i dont want to read benson's shitty writing and fix it all

business rule: to some people mana means certain things. define it. (in gamerules sense)

USE CASE DIAGRAM:
 - from actor to bubble: good
 - from bubble to bubble: need <<include>> or <<extends>> or whatever you make up, but define what that means.

VYBS'S FEEDBACK
===============
change process diagram to state
dated activity:
  move 6.5 around to many places
  add milestones to parts not there
  make sure higher blocks always happen first
  can write on side: winter break, etc
milestones:
  remove deliverables
  add milestones for empty points
  adjust table size
phase: remove weekends
explain costs
add costs
change risks
team management
client hypothetical user
add fluff
pygame is a LIBRARY
point out unit tests are done with pygame/python built-ins
