=================
-- SMALL TODOS -- 
If you're bored and looking for something to add to this fix deez things.
=================
- Screen transitions are HI-LARIOUSLY bad. Fix dat.
- Imports from different directories so that it's not a file-dump.
- Fix the hitboxes on the clicks because they're ALMOST right?

=================
-- LARGE TODOS --
=================
- Any game logic, whatsoever.
- Upgrade screen
- Pause menu
- Options in the main menu currently do nothing, and work similarly
  to the newgame submenu, for some reason. This is not expected behaviour.

====================
-- POSSIBLE FIXES --
====================
- Perhaps we should make a "button" class that associates visuals and click/overboxes.
  - in that case MouseHitboxes should be a composite pattern, which could get a little ugly but doable.
